I had used automated browsing with Splinter to visit the Mars news site and extracted the HTML code with Beautiful Soup. 
The titles and preview text of the news articles were scraped and extracted, and I stored the information in a list of dictionaries as specified. 
For Part 2, I've extracted the HTML table into a Pandas DataFrame, ensuring the columns had the correct headings and data types. My analysis was thorough, answering questions about the number of months on Mars, 
the number of Martian days' worth of data, and creating data visualizations to determine which month has the lowest and highest temperatures and atmospheric pressures. 
Additionally, I have estimated the number of terrestrial days in a Martian year within 25% accuracy and exported the DataFrame into a CSV file.
